This is an implementation of a popular tutorial series. As such, it includes plenty of unoriginal code.

Here is a link to the source material: (https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)

The tutorial is based on the python-tcod library, a Python port of libtcod, a lightweight API designed for roguelike game development that includes support for true color console-based rendering, pathfinding, and dynamic field-of-view, among other features.

I have several learning objectives for this project:

	1. Improve Python skill and knowledge of associated libraries including python-tcod and numpy
	
	2. Develop familiarity with Git workflow and interacting with a remote repository

	3. Build knowledge base of game development concepts and design techniques including structures, 	patterns, and procedural generation strategies
